Scripts for paper looking at brain connectomics predicting suicidal ideation severity. The first 6 scripts wrangle graph metrics. Script 8 computes suicidal ideation severity scores (the response distribution) and log transforms this variable since it is positively skewed. Script 10 performs a lasso regression using glmnet and loocv. Script 11 conducts supplementary zero-order correlations.
